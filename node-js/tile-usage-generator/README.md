# ArcGIS services usage generator

The purpose of this project is to generate usage against ArcGIS services. I use this to test the services are working properly and the correct usage metering is taking place.

## Set up

1. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

2. Create or edit `.env` to set your ArcGIS **client ID**, **client secret**, and **API key** on the account you want to test.

3. Edit `index.js` to set up the tests you want to run and any parameters to control the test.

4. Run `npm start`
