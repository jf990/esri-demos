# Welcome to Esri and ArcGIS

**ArcGIS** from [Esri](https://esri.com) provides powerful software and useful content for mapping and GIS (geographic information systems). This is software you can download, install, and run on your own machine, or you can use ArcGIS Online to work with these apps and tools on the cloud through a browser. ArcGIS also provides developer tools and APIs that allow you to build your own custom software solution utilizing location services and content management.

## Sign-up

A great way to get started is to sign-up for a free Developer subscription of ArcGIS Platform: https://developers.arcgis.com/

This is not a free trial, but a perpetually free subscription that gives you a base level of cloud storage and processing for hosting data, making maps, and sharing those maps and data visualizations with others, either by themselves, or wrapped inside highly customized web applications, with or without any coding on your part.

## What can ArcGIS do?

Visit https://developers.arcgis.com/features/ and click through the list of capabilities and see if you can make use of those. Each capability leads to demo apps, sample code, and further details about each service and how to use it.

## Getting started

When you're ready to get hands-on, here are the first 4 self-paced tutorials (10-15-min each) we recommend you use for getting started:

1. Import data: https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-location-services/data/tutorials/tools/import-data-as-a-feature-layer/
2. Create a web map: https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-location-services/maps/tutorials/tools/create-a-web-map/
3. Style feature layers: https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-location-services/visualization/tutorials/tools/style-layers-web-map/
4. Create a new dataset: https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-location-services/data/tutorials/tools/create-a-new-feature-layer/

## For developers

If you are a web developer, or have some experience with JavaScript, try these:

* Display a map: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/display-a-map/
* Change the basemap layer: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/change-the-basemap-layer/
* Search for an address: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/search-for-an-address/
* Find places: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/find-places/
               
There are hundreds more short tutorials, most under 15 minutes each:

## For data scientists

You can use the ArcGIS API for Python to bring ArcGIS into your analytical workflows, perhaps with Jupyter Notebooks.
ArcGIS Pro has an ArcPy module as a Python interface to desktop workstation GIS capabilities.

## Map content you can use

You can mix and overlay your map data with any number of thousands of other map layers of useful data made available through the Living Atlas of the World: https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/

## Building web apps for your maps

When you want to share your map inside of a custom web app, with tools your end-users can use, a great place to start is the ArcGIS Web AppBuilder:

If you're familiar with the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, well, you can make dashboards too, by clicking and dragging:

Another great way to share maps, charts, images, and multimedia is by telling a story. Try ArcGIS Story Maps:
