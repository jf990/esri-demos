# Basic demo with ArcGIS API for JavaScript

This is the most simple demo to get started with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/). The code is based on several tutorials found on the ArcGIS Developer website, starting with [Display a map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/display-a-map/).

To run this demo:

1. create a new file named `secret.js` and add your API key.

```javascript
var MY_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

2. load `index.html` in a web browser. You should not need to install anything else.
